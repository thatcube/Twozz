/// Installs Night Shift's tint so it floats above *everything* — including the
/// player and other `fullScreenCover`s — without ever stealing focus, and tints
/// by **multiplying** the app rather than painting a wash on top.
///
/// Why multiply, and why it must live in the app's own window: a real
/// colour-temperature filter (and the system's Color Filters) multiplies the
/// screen — it scales the green/blue channels down to redden the picture while
/// leaving red (and therefore black) untouched, so nothing is brightened.
/// Source-over compositing can't do that; it always lifts dark pixels toward the
/// tint colour, which reads as a bright orange/red glow. Core Animation honours a
/// `multiplyBlendMode` compositing filter only when the tint layer composites
/// *within the same window* as the content — tvOS's window server ignores it
/// across separate windows. So instead of a dedicated overlay window, we add a
/// passthrough tint view directly into the app's main window and push it to the
/// front with a very high `zPosition`, which keeps it above the modally-presented
/// covers (player, chat, multiview, sign-in) that are sibling subviews of that
/// same window.

// MARK: - Tint view

/// The SwiftUI content hosted in the overlay: one opaque rectangle filled with
/// `overlayMultiplyColor`. The host view's layer multiplies it against the app
/// (see the installer), so this colour acts as a per-channel scale — white by day
/// (×1, invisible), redder as night deepens (green/blue scaled down). Dimness is
/// folded into the same colour as an all-channel scale. `allowsHitTesting(false)`
/// is belt-and-braces alongside the host view's disabled interaction.
